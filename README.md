# Description
This is my training repository documenting all project I have created learning SQL and all its flavours. Below is a short description of each project and ERD diagrams of created databases.

# Project 1 - [EDS](https://github.com/mzalewska89/SQL/tree/main/Project%20_EDS) #
## *Oracle DB* ##
A simple database that consists of 3 tables - Employees, Departments and Salary grade, accompanied by 90 different SELECT queries, varying in the level of difficulty. It includes various examples of:
* basic SELECT queries
* joins
* aggregate function 
* subqueries 
<br><br>It is a class project from one of polish Universities of Technology. 

# Project 2 - [Store](https://github.com/mzalewska89/SQL/tree/main/Project%20-%20Store) #
## *Oracle DB* ##
It is a more complex database that presents a structure of a food store. It was a subject of an online SQL course that I recently took. The database was developed over time and all examples of queries were presented in a more real-life way. \
Both DDL and DML examples can be found there in bulk. 

# Project 3 - [School](https://github.com/mzalewska89/SQL/tree/main/Project%20_school) #

It is first mini project created entirely by myself (the whole structure of database, as well as the queries). It presents a structure of a University (its students, teachers, departments, courses and many relations within the above. It contains both DDL and DML examples of queries. 

# Project 4 - [The Office](https://github.com/mzalewska89/SQL/tree/main/Project_TheOffice) #
